# Introduction

It provides the scientific basis for the study and a (brief) review of the current literature, 
the key question(s) for you research leading -up to the next section about your specific hypotheses or objectives

# Research objectives and hypotheses

Specific hypotheses (in the case of hypothesis-testing science) or objectives (in the case of 
descriptive science), and the underlying logic, for each proposed thesis chapter (minimum three 
for PhD students)

# Proposed methodologies

Include outlines of data collection and data analysis

Outline any special skills, equipment, or techniques that will be required. 

# Expected Products

A list of the (usually 1/3) articles expected for completion of the MSC/PhD. Think of each as a fantasy abstract.

1. The Evolution of Human Uniqueness
  There is wide agreement that humans are unique. But it is rarely asked: Have they always been unique? In this paper, we derive a general uniqueness theorem that states that any unique species must have been less unique at some point in the past. This theorem has implications for the achievement of world peace.

1. Niche Construction, Disease Transmission, and Global Warming: Chaos Deconstructs the Block Chain
  How many buzz words can be combined in a title? In this paper, we find that the natural limit on buzz words in any specific scholarly field is always given by the triangular number $T_n$ where $n$ is one more than the number of tenured faculty in the field.

1. A Bayesian Hierarchical Survival Analysis of Counting Sheep
  Just like all those other models of counting sheep, but this one will be Bayesian.

# Scientific value and rationale for the research

# Course selection


# Schedule

Outline of the calendar for the work. This is necessarily rough and subject to change.
